    I love using neovim. It is such a powerful tool and such a joy to use. I have created a few plugins for it, namely projektgunnar and tomat.

    I live in the south of Sweden with my wife and three kids. I love to spend time with my family and friends. I also love to play computer games and to read books. I prefer quiet and alone time to recharge my batteries.

    I've been coding for a living since 2008. I started out with C++. In 2010 I started to work with web development in C# and I've been doing that ever since.
    Lately I've started learning node.js.
    I'm also working on learning Lua as I find that a very interesting language. Hence the plugins projektgunnar and tomat.
    2021 I made the switch to Linux from Windows and I've never looked back. I love the freedom and the power that Linux gives me.
    2022 I decided to give neovim a try. At first I bounced off it and went back to Rider and used the IdeaVim plugin. The thought kept coming back to me and I decided to give neovim a solid week before I wrote it off. After that week I have no thoughts of stopping.
